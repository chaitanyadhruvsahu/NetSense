## 🌍 Problem Statement

In today’s remote-first world, people depend heavily on internet connectivity.
Hotels, cafés, and coworking spaces often claim **“high-speed WiFi”**, but in reality:

* Speeds are inconsistent
* Connections drop during meetings
* No way to verify reliability beforehand

👉 Users lack a **trustable system to evaluate WiFi quality in real-time**

---

## 💡 Solution

**NetVerity AI** provides:

* A **Speed Test Interface** (modern UI like real tools)
* AI-based **WiFi Trust Score (0–100)**
* Smart **recommendations based on network conditions**
* Future-ready architecture for **real network testing**

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ⚡ Speed Test Interface

* Circular animated speed meter
* Real-time testing phases:

  * Download test
  * Upload test
  * Ping analysis

---

### 🤖 AI-Based Trust Scoring

* Uses Machine Learning (Decision Tree)
* Predicts network quality:

  * Excellent 🚀
  * Good 👍
  * Moderate ⚠️
  * Poor ❌

---

### 📊 Smart Recommendations

* Suggests:

  * Best time for meetings
  * Suitable work type
* Example:

  * “Good for meetings in morning”
  * “Avoid video calls at night”

---

### 🧠 Intelligent Inputs

* Download speed
* Upload speed
* Ping (latency)
* Jitter
* Packet loss
* Signal strength
* Users connected
* Time of day
* Location type
